  <h1>Wiggle Bad</h1>
  <p>We recently discovered our MySpage page no longer works. We've worked with the world's best technoligists to develop our new cutting edge website in an effort to set a new started for band websites.</p>
  <h2> The Wiggle Bad Story</h2>
  <p>A group of elite musicians formed a supergroup with the sole focus of performing msuic at its highest level. 
    Acceptance into the hallowed halls of Wiggle Bad required more than just a mastering of musical prowess. All band members have had vasectomies. 
    Post snipping, standard medical practice requires submission of a sample to determine if the surgery was successful. 
    Sample analysis reveals two potention outcomes: No wigggle - GOOD! Wiggle - BAD.
  </p>
  <h2> Our Rigs </h2>
  <p> As elite musicans, we are no longer encurmbered by playing acutal instuments.  After a (not) extensive evalution, we landed on using Guiter Hero instuments and lip synching.
    This allows us the flexibility to perform any song with the tediousness of "practice".
    </p>
